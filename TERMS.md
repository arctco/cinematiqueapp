## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By installing or using cinematique, you signify your acceptance of these Terms of Use. If you do not agree to these terms, please refrain from using the app.

---

## 2. Use of the App

cinematique is intended for personal, non-commercial use. You may use the app to track and organize your media preferences. You agree not to misuse the app, attempt unauthorized access, or distribute harmful content.

---

## 3. Privacy and Data Storage

cinematique is built with a privacy-first philosophy:

* No user accounts are required.
* Your tracking data (e.g., watched content, lists) is stored **locally** in your deviceâ€™s browser storage.
* No analytics or personal data is collected, stored, or shared by the developer.

You may export your data at any time and back it up locally or via services like Google Drive (see below). The developer has no access to your data.

## 4. Third-Party Services & Data Sources

### TMDB (The Movie Database)

cinematique uses TMDB's API to retrieve public movie and TV data such as titles, posters, overviews, and ratings. Optionally, you may connect your TMDB account to sync your watchlist and personal ratings. Detailed progress, such as watched episodes and custom lists, remains local to your device.

Usage of TMDB data is subject to [TMDB's Terms of Use](https://www.themoviedb.org/terms-of-use) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.themoviedb.org/privacy-policy).

### Trakt.tv

cinematique displays community ratings from Trakt.tv anonymously to enhance content discovery. You may optionally connect your Trakt.tv account for two-way sync of your watch history, ratings, and collection. This integration is optional and governed by Trakt.tvâ€™s Terms and Privacy Policy.

### Google Drive

cinematique includes an optional Google Drive integration to let users back up and restore their local data. When connected, the app stores a single file (`cinematique_backup.json`) in your personal Drive account. The developer has no access to your Drive or any of its files.

Use of this feature is governed by [Googleâ€™s Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms).

### Google Gemini API

AI-powered features such as summaries, recommendations, and chat use the Google Gemini API. These features:

* Send only non-personal prompt data (e.g., titles, messages) to Google.
* Never transmit identifying or account data.
* Can be accessed without logging in by providing your own API key (optional).

Your API key, if provided, is stored locally and not shared with cinematique. Usage is subject to [Googleâ€™s API Terms](https://cloud.google.com/terms).

All AI tools are optional and clearly marked with a âœ¨ icon.

## 5. AI Content Disclaimer

AI-generated summaries and suggestions may contain errors or biases. They are provided for informational purposes only and do not reflect the views of the developer.

---

## 6. Content Disclaimer

cinematique does not host or link to any streaming media. All media-related data (e.g., posters, metadata, summaries) is provided by third-party APIs and may not always be accurate.

---

## 7. Modifications to Terms

These terms may be updated from time to time. Changes will be posted within the app or repository. Continued use of the app after such updates constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.
