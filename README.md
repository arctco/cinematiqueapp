## 🚀 About This Project

cinematique was born from a simple idea: to create a beautiful, modern, and intelligent way to keep up with the ever-expanding universe of movies and TV shows. It's designed to be local-first, meaning your data stays with you, with optional cloud sync via TMDB if needed.

### Core Pillars

* **Privacy First & Local**: All your data is saved on your device. No accounts. No tracking.
* **Community-Powered Data**: Media info is powered by TMDB's open API.
* **Intelligently Simple**: Optional AI features powered by Google's Gemini API for smart discovery.

---

## 🛠 How It's Made

* **React**: Modern frontend built with the latest React features.
* **The Movie Database (TMDB)**: Community-driven source of film and TV metadata.
* **Google Gemini API**: Optional AI features like summaries, chat, and recommendations.

## 🔐 Privacy and Data

cinematique was built with privacy as a top priority:

* No user accounts or logins.
* No analytics or trackers.
* All tracking data (watched episodes, custom lists) is stored in your browser's local storage.

### Third-Party Services

* **TMDB**: Optional sync for your public TMDB watchlist. Custom lists and episode progress remain local.
* **Google Gemini**: Optional AI tools send only non-personal data to Gemini. You can provide your own Gemini API key, stored locally, for unlimited use.
